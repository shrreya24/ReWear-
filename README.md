# 👕♻️ ReWear — Community Clothing Exchange Platform (Hackathon Demo)

**ReWear** is a web-based platform developed as part of a hackathon round for **Odoo**.  

The goal is to promote sustainable fashion and reduce textile waste by enabling users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system.  

⚠️ **Note:** This project is a demonstration/reference build specifically designed for the hackathon, and not intended for direct production use.
